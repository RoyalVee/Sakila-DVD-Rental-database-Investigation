# Sakila DVD Rental database Investigation
In this project, I did a query analysis on the Sakila DVD Rental database. 

# Description
The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. 
I queried the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as 
- what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, 
- how they compare on payment earnings, 
- and how the stores compare in their performance.
